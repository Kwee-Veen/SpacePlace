        <p><br>Starship is a fully reusable transport system in development by SpaceX.<br><br>
        Formerly known as BFR (Big F***ing Rocket), Starship is being designed to transport humans & cargo both on earth and to the moon, Mars & beyond.<br><br>
        Starship is designed to be <span class = "emphasis">fully and rapidly reusable.</span><br><br> 
        This means the principal hardware elements are not discarded or allowed to burn up, but instead return to the ground so they can be flown again.</p>

        The combined system will stand 120m tall, <span class = "emphasis">roughly equivalent to a 35-story building</span><br><br>
        With over twice the thrust of the Saturn V rocket that took humans to the moon, <span class = "emphasis">Starship will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever developed.</span></p>

        <p>The Super Heavy Booster possesses 33 Raptor boosters, while the Starship spacecraft possesses 6.<br><br>
        In addition to being among the most advanced engines ever created, Raptor engines are fueled a combination of liquid oxygen & methane<br><br>
        This fuel could theoretically be <span class = "emphasis">produced using resources discoverable on the moon or Mars</span>, adding to the rocket's reusability</p>
