        Artemis is led by NASA & partnered with the European, Canadian & Japanese space agencies.<br><br> 
        The program's long-term goal is to <span class = "emphasis">establish a permanent base camp on the Moon and facilitate human missions to Mars.</span></p>

        The major components of the program are the Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft, Lunar Gateway space station and the Human Landing System.<br><br>
        Unlike the other program components, the Human Landing System is to be commercially developed by private industries<br><br>
        The contract was awarded to SpaceX in July 2021 for an initial $2.89bn, modified in Nov 2022 by an additional $1.15bn.<br><br>

        <p>Artemis will establish a new space station, a suite of new lunar science instruments and technology demonstrations, and establish a long term lunar presence.<br><br> 
        The agency will leverage its Artemis experiences and technologies to prepare for the next giant leap – sending astronauts to Mars.<br><br>
